# NeuroMod
A Python library that simulates the modular interactions between different brain regions (like the Pre-Frontal Cortex, Hippocampus, and Basal Ganglia) to enhance LLMs with cognitive abilities such as memory retention, decision-making, and context-switching.
Concept:
A Python library that simulates the modular interactions between different brain regions (like the Pre-Frontal Cortex, Hippocampus, and Basal Ganglia) to enhance LLMs with cognitive abilities such as memory retention, decision-making, and context-switching. The library will allow developers to add specialized cognitive modules to existing LLMs, making them more adaptive and capable of handling complex tasks requiring multitasking, memory, and decision-making.

Innovative Aspect:
This library goes beyond current prompt-based NLP approaches by simulating how specific brain regions function in conjunction with each other. It leverages a modular approach, allowing users to plug in different "brain region" modules that can enhance LLM capabilities in specialized cognitive tasks.
